# MCMCPLP - Monte Carlo Markov Chain in Probabilistic Logic Programs

Masters' Degree Classwork - Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ)

The following classwork addresses the problem of inference and structure learning in probabilistic logic programs, extending the common deterministic scenario. Structure learning in a probabilistic scenario seeks to learn rules through facts and examples that are probabilistic, that is, have associated probabilities or uncertainties. The first problem consists of performing inference efficiently in the probabilistic setting, where queries have a certain probability of being proved. The second uses probabilistic inference and the MCMC technique to learn rules through probabilistic facts.

For learning structures from probabilistic facts it is proposed to use the MCMC method to perform a search in the space of defined clauses that best explain a target predicate.
